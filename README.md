# Chicago Crime Analytics: Domestic Crime Prediction Using Big Data & SparkML

**Predictive Modeling on 8M+ Real Crime Records using PySpark on Databricks**  
_By Yogesh Sivakumar

## Overview

Built a binary classifier to predict whether a reported crime in Chicago was domestic or non-domestic using 8M+ records from 2000‚Äì2025. Leveraged big data tools on Databricks with PySpark, SparkSQL, and SparkML. Performed feature engineering, statistical tests, and optimization to handle the large dataset effectively.


## Objectives

- Predict domestic crimes using historical data
- Handle big data using scalable tools (PySpark & SparkSQL)
- Evaluate model performance and provide actionable insights


## Tools & Techniques

- **Platform**: Databricks Community Edition
- **Tech Stack**: PySpark, SparkSQL, SparkML
- **Model**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- **Optimization**: Caching, Repartitioning

## Key Results

| Metric       | Value   |
|--------------|---------|
| Accuracy     | 88.7%   |
| Precision    | 87.9%   |
| Recall       | 88.0%   |
| F1-Score     | 87.9%   |
